## Description

This is a streamlit app that we created at Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp. First we created an API, then put it in a Docker container and hosted it on Google Cloud. This API contains a Deep Learning Model (LSTM RNN) which is used to predict Ethereum price 24h in advance. It also contains a separate algorithmic-trading strategy which we can backtest in the app.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create something fun using some of the technologies we have used in the bootcamp, namely Docker, Cloud hosting, ML/Deep Learning, creating APIs etc.

## Functionality / Features

The main features for this app are:

- Ethereum Price Prediction (24h in advance)
- Backtesting our algorithmic trading strategy
